### Abstract

Increasing levels of distributed solar photovoltaic (PV) generation has created significant technical challenges in distribution networks, particularly regarding voltage regulation. **Small-scale behind-the-meter battery storage is a key element** in effectively overcoming such challenges, while offering financial benefits for customers.

In this paper, **we propose an optimization-based approach for dispatching power from residential-scale battery storage for grid support and customer savings**, considering only local (behind-the-meter) measurements.

The proposed approach takes into account:

- the physics of the grid, and
- both real and reactive power (coupled).

For **voltage regulation** and **grid loss reduction**.

> The optimization-based approach, termed **Local-Quadratic Program (L-QP)**, is formulated based on the linear power flow equations (**LinDistFlow**).

The proposed L-QP is benchmarked against an approach in which real power is used to maximize the customer benefit, while reactive power is dedicated for voltage regulation.

Numerical simulations with the **IEEE 13** and **IEEE 123** Node Test Feeders, which include realistic time-varying data for residential load and PV generation, demonstrate the technical advantages of the proposed approach.
